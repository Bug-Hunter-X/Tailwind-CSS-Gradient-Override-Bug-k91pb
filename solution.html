```html
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 relative">
  <!-- Add any content here -->
</div>
```

**Explanation of Solution:**

The issue was solved by ensuring no conflicting styles were applied to the element with the gradient.  In more complex scenarios where you need to layer backgrounds, use `relative` positioning and z-index to manage layering, or carefully examine and adjust your class ordering.
