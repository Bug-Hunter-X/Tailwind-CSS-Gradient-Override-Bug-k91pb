```html
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 ...">
</div>
```

This code uses Tailwind CSS's gradient feature.  However, if the `...` contains conflicting classes that affect the background, the gradient might not appear correctly or might be overridden unexpectedly. For example, a class setting a solid background color (`bg-red-500`) would completely override the gradient.
