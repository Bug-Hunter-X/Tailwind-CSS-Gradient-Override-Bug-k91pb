# Tailwind CSS Gradient Override Bug

This repository demonstrates a common issue when using Tailwind CSS gradients: unexpected behavior when conflicting classes affect background styles. The gradient might not render properly or be entirely overwritten by other styles.

The `bug.html` file showcases the issue.  The `solution.html` file offers a fix by carefully managing class order or using utility classes to achieve the desired effect.
